00:04-00:21
The lecture left off discussing the themes from the previous class.

00:21-00:26
The speaker mentions notes on the Salem witch trials that he needs to give to someone.

00:26-00:33
The lecture briefly discussed the Salem witch trial and witch hunting in general.

00:33-01:31
The history of the criminalization of women is directly intertwined with the history of colonization.

01:31-01:37
The history of witch hunting goes back to the 13 hundreds in what is now Germany.

01:37-01:44
During this time, Europe was recovering from the Black Death, a deadly plague that caused a significant decrease in population and workforce.

01:44-02:13
As a result of the Black Death, there was available land and a surplus of unemployed people.

02:13-02:28
The commons, which were communal lands, became a valuable resource for people to grow crops and let livestock graze.

02:28-02:54
In the mid-1400s, feudal Lords started to enclose the commons and convert them into private property.

02:54-03:23
This enclosure affected many women who were unmarried, widowed, or homeless, as they relied on the commons for survival.

03:23-03:28
These women became displaced and received no compensation for the loss of the commons.

03:28-04:16
In the mid-14th century, feudal Lords began to enclose the commons, which were communal lands used by the entire village or town.

04:16-04:51
During the 14th and 15th centuries in Europe, feudal Lords wanted to enclose the commons, which were communal lands. This posed a problem for unmarried or widowed women who were considered cunning women, often serving as midwives and healers for the community. These women went against patriarchal norms and challenged the authority of the Catholic Church. In order to remove these women from the commons, they were criminalized and labeled as witches.

4:51-5:58
During the 14th to 16th centuries, feudal lords in Europe wanted to enclose the commons, communal lands that were used by everyone in a village or town. This resulted in the displacement of women, especially those who were unmarried, widowed, or homeless. These women were often known as cunning women and were typically older, spoke out against authority, and provided reproductive care and healing to the community. To justify enclosing the commons and remove these women, they were criminalized and labelled as witches.

05:53-07:17
The lecture discusses the history of witch hunting and how it is connected to the process of colonization. In medieval Europe, women who were deemed 'cunning' and went against authority, particularly the Catholic church, were targeted. These women were often unmarried, widows, or homeless and provided remedies and reproductive care to the community. Feudal Lords wanted to enclose communal land and criminalized these women as witches to remove them. The process of villainizing women as witches involved propaganda and paintings depicting them engaging in sexual acts with the devil and practicing cannibalism. This demonization spread slowly due to limited communication. By the 1540s, during Spain's colonial efforts, similar tactics were used to demonize indigenous people and justify their subjugation.

07:23-08:08
Spain used similar tactics of demonizing indigenous people to justify their colonization efforts in Latin America.

06:00-08:10
During the lecture, the professor discusses the history of witch hunting and its connection to colonization. In the 13th to 16th centuries in Europe, feudal Lords wanted to enclose the commons, which were communal plots of land. However, there were many women, known as cunning women, who were widows or unmarried and used the commons. These women were seen as a threat to authority and went against the role of the Catholic church as the sole arbiter of knowledge and healing. To remove them from the commons, they were criminalized and labeled as witches. The propaganda against them included depictions of them having sex with the devil, having familiars, and being cannibals. This process of demonizing women as witches spread slowly across Europe due to limited communication. By the 1540s, during Spain's colonial efforts in Latin America, similar arguments and demonization were used against indigenous people to justify their subjugation and exploitation.

07:40-08:13
By the time we get to the 1540s, when Spain is ramping up its colonization efforts in Latin America, they need ways to demonize the indigenous people to justify their subjugation, exploitation, and theft of their lives. They use the same arguments that they used against women in the 1300s and 1400s to paint the indigenous people as evil and justify their mistreatment.

05:49-07:40
The lecture discusses the connection between the history of colonization and the criminalization of women, particularly in the context of witch trials. It explains that during the 14th-16th centuries, feudal Lords wanted to enclose common lands, and the women who used these lands were marginalized and criminalized. These women, known as cunning women, often provided reproductive care and healing services outside the influence of the Catholic church. In order to justify their persecution, they were labeled as witches through propaganda and paintings depicting them engaging in cannibalism and in congress with the devil. This narrative spread slowly across Europe due to limited communication. By the 1540s, these arguments were then used to demonize indigenous people in the context of colonization efforts by Spain in Latin America.

05:53-08:22
The lecture discusses the history of witch hunting and its connection to colonization. It explains how the feudal Lords in the 14th century started enclosing the commons, which were communal lands, to turn them into private properties. This threatened the presence of women, particularly cunning women who were outspoken, older, and provided reproductive care, going against the authority of the Catholic Church. To remove these women from the commons, they were criminalized as witches. Witches were portrayed as engaging in sexual activities with the devil, having familiars, and being cannibals. This demonization of women as witches continued for hundreds of years, spreading slowly across Europe due to the lack of communication. By the 1540s, the same arguments used against women in the 13th and 14th centuries were used to demonize indigenous peoples in Latin America and justify their subjugation and exploitation during the colonization period.

05:53-07:10
The lecturer discusses the history of witch hunting and its connection to colonization. During the Black Death in Europe, when the population was reduced, there was available land and unemployed people. The feudal Lords sought to enclose the commons, communal land, which posed a problem for women who were unmarried, widows, or homeless. These women, known as cunning women, were often older, spoke out against authority, and provided healing and reproductive care to the community, challenging the role of the Catholic church. To remove them from the commons, they were criminalized and labeled as witches. The lecturer explains that the process of villainizing women as witches involved themes of engaging in congress with the devil, having familiars, and being cannibals. This history of criminalizing and demonizing women as witches later influenced the colonization efforts of Spain in Latin America, where the same arguments were used to justify the subjugation and exploitation of indigenous peoples.

07:17-08:25
By the 1540s, during Spain's colonization efforts in Latin America, the arguments used against women in the past were applied to indigenous peoples to demonize them and justify their subjugation. The lecturer mentions paintings that depicted indigenous people in a similar light as the witches, emphasizing the continuity of this propaganda across time and regions.

07:40-08:35
By the time we get to the 1540s, when Spain is ramping up colonization efforts in Latin America, they need ways to demonize the indigenous people to justify their exploitation of them. They use the same arguments that they used against women in the 13th and 14th centuries to criminalize and enclose the common land belonging to indigenous peoples. Paintings from that time show indigenous people depicted as cannibals, just like how they portrayed women as cannibals during the witch trials.

05:53-08:06
The lecture discusses the connection between the history of colonization and the criminalization of women, specifically in the context of witch trials. The speaker explains that in the 14th and 15th centuries, feudal lords began enclosing common lands, resulting in many homeless women, often referred to as 'cunning women.' These women were perceived as a threat to patriarchal authority and the monopoly of the Catholic Church on knowledge and healing. Consequently, they were labeled as witches and subjected to witch trials. The speaker highlights the propaganda campaign used to depict these women as witches, with themes such as engaging in congress with the devil, having familiars, and being cannibals. This history of demonizing women as witches continued for centuries and was later used to justify the demonization and exploitation of indigenous peoples during colonization.

05:53-08:09
The lecture discusses the history of witch hunting and its connection to the colonization of indigenous peoples. During the 13th to 16th centuries, witches were criminalized and painted as evil by the feudal Lords and the Catholic Church. These women, referred to as cunning women, were often unmarried, widowed, or homeless. They were knowledgeable in medicine and reproductive care, going against the authority of the church. The feudal Lords wanted to enclose the common land and used witchcraft accusations to remove these women. They spread propaganda and used paintings to depict witches engaging in cannibalism and intercourse with the devil. These tactics were later used by the Spanish colonizers to demonize and subjugate indigenous people in Latin America.

08:03-09:00
The lecture discusses how the arguments used to demonize and criminalize women in the 13th and 14th centuries during the witch trials were later used against indigenous peoples during the colonization of Latin America. Similar paintings were created that depicted indigenous people as cannibals and devil worshipers, just like the witches in Europe. Additionally, it is mentioned that only one indigenous society is known to have practiced cannibalism, and it was more ritualistic than depicted in the paintings.

07:33-09:09
By the time we get to the 1540s, Spain's colonization efforts in Latin America are ramping up. They need ways to demonize the indigenous people to justify their subjugation, exploitation, and theft of their lands. They use the same arguments and techniques that were used against women in the 13th and 14th centuries. They paint the indigenous people as cannibals, devil worshipers, and users of familiars, just like the witches from the past.

07:23-09:13
By the time we get to the 1540s, Spain's colonization efforts in Latin America needed ways to demonize indigenous people to justify their subjugation and exploitation. They used the same arguments they used against women in the 13th and 14th centuries to criminalize indigenous peoples and to enclose common land. Paintings at the time depicted indigenous people as cannibals and devil worshipers, similar to how they portrayed witches.

07:17-09:16
The lecture discusses how the techniques used to criminalize and villainize women during the witch trials in the 13th and 14th centuries were later applied to indigenous peoples during the colonization efforts in Latin America by the Spanish. The lecturer explains that the same arguments and propaganda used against women during the witch trials, such as claiming they had sex with the devil, had familiars, and were cannibals, were also used to demonize and justify the subjugation and exploitation of indigenous peoples. This connection between the history of witch hunting and colonization highlights the intertwined histories of the criminalization of women's autonomy and the colonization of indigenous lands.

08:03-09:23
In the lecture from 8:03 to 9:23, the professor discussed the techniques used to villainize indigenous peoples and justify their exploitation by the Spaniards during the colonization of Latin America. This was done by using similar arguments and propaganda as those used against women during the witch trials in Germany in the 14th and 15th centuries. The professor mentioned that indigenous people were depicted as cannibals, devil worshipers, and having familiar spirits, among other things. This comparison highlights the interconnectedness of the history of colonization and the criminalization of women.

07:33-09:36
The lecture discusses how the techniques used to villainize women during the witch trials of the 13th and 14th centuries were later employed to demonize indigenous peoples by the Spaniards during their colonization efforts in Latin America.

07:23-09:48
The lecture discusses the connection between the history of witch hunting and the history of colonization. It begins by explaining the background of the witch trials, which originated in the 13th century in Germany. During the 14th and 15th centuries, feudal Lords sought to enclose the commons, communal land used by the community. This process involved criminalizing and removing women who were seen as a threat to authority, particularly cunning women who engaged in reproductive care and healing outside of the Catholic Church's control. These women were labeled as witches, and the criminalization of women as witches continued for centuries. The lecture then connects this history to colonization, noting that when Spain began its colonization efforts in Latin America in the 1540s, they used similar arguments to demonize and subjugate indigenous peoples. Paintings and propaganda depicted indigenous people as cannibals, witches, and devil worshippers, similar to how women were portrayed during the witch trials. The lecture concludes by highlighting the Salem witch trials in 1692 as an example of the European witch hunting tradition being transported to the United States.

07:17-09:53
The lecture discusses the history of witch hunting, which dates back to the 13th century in Europe. This was a period after the Black Death, where there was a shortage of workforce and available land. Feudal Lords wanted to enclose the common land, and in doing so, they had to get rid of women who didn't fit societal norms and were often called cunning women. These women were older, unmarried or widowed, and played the roles of midwives or healers. They provided reproductive care and medicinal remedies, which went against the authority of the Catholic church. To criminalize and demonize these women, they were labeled as witches and subjected to persecution. The lecture highlights the common themes used to villainize witches, including engaging in intercourse with the devil, having familiars, and practicing cannibalism. The techniques used against women during the witch trials were later employed to demonize indigenous peoples during colonization, justifying the subjugation and exploitation of indigenous communities. The Salem witch trials, occurring in the 1690s, took place at the tail end of this larger witch-hunting phase and were influenced by the European witch trials.

07:17-09:59
The lecture discusses the connection between the witch trials in Europe and the colonization of indigenous peoples in Latin America. It explains how the witch trials in Europe were used to criminalize and remove women from common land, and how similar tactics were later used to demonize and subjugate indigenous peoples in the Americas. The lecture describes the propaganda and stereotypes used against women during the witch trials, such as accusing them of having sex with the devil, using familiars, and practicing cannibalism. It highlights the similarities between the paintings and arguments used against women in the 13th and 14th centuries and those used against indigenous peoples in the 16th century. The lecture suggests that the Salem witch trials in the United States were a continuation of this European witch hunting tradition.

05:49-10:04
The lecturer discusses the history of witch hunting and its connection to the colonization of indigenous peoples. In the 13th and 14th centuries, feudal lords began enclosing common lands, and women who were perceived as threatening to authority, such as widows and older healers, were seen as witches and targeted. They were accused of engaging in sexual activities with the devil, having familiars, and practicing cannibalism. These accusations were used to vilify them and justify their removal from the common land. Similar techniques were later used by the Spaniards to demonize and exploit indigenous peoples during colonization. The Salem witch trials in the 1690s were a result of this European phenomenon being transported to the United States. The lecturer also mentions a theory that the consumption of moldy bread potentially played a role in the witch trials.

05:49-07:10
The lecture discusses the connection between the history of colonization and the criminalization of women, particularly in relation to the witch trials. It explains that during the 13th and 14th centuries, feudal Lords sought to enclose the commons, which were communal lands, and in order to do so, they criminalized women, labeling them as witches. These women, often called cunning women, defied authority and provided reproductive care and healing outside of the control of the Catholic church. The lecture highlights how the tactics used to villainize these women in Europe were later employed by the Spaniards to demonize indigenous peoples during colonization. The same arguments and images used against women in the witch trials were used to depict indigenous people as cannibals, devil worshipers, and in Congress with the devil.

08:03-09:10
The lecturer mentions the Salem witch trials as part of the broader witch hunting phenomenon that occurred in Europe. They suggest that one theory for the cause of the Salem witch trials is the consumption of moldy bread, which may have caused hallucinations.

08:03-09:16
The lecture discusses the connection between the villainization of women during witch trials in 13th-17th century Europe and the demonization of indigenous peoples during the colonization of Latin America. The speaker explains that during the witch trials, women who were considered disobedient and went against the authority of the Catholic Church were labeled as witches. They were accused of having sex with the devil, having familiars, and being cannibals. Similar arguments and paintings were later used to demonize indigenous peoples and justify their subjugation and exploitation by the Spaniards in Latin America.

07:17-07:40
Between the 1350s and 1360s, the witch trials began in Europe and continued for hundreds of years, taking place at a slow pace due to limited communication.

07:40-09:23
In the 1540s, during Spain's colonization efforts in Latin America, they used similar tactics as the witch trials to villainize indigenous people and justify their exploitation.

09:23-09:36
These techniques of demonization, including accusations of cannibalism and devil worship, originated in Germany during the witch trials and later spread to the United States, leading to events like the Salem witch trials in 1692.

09:36-09:59
One theory behind the Salem witch trials is that the hallucinogenic effects of moldy bread caused the accused individuals to experience hallucinations and behave irrationally.

09:59-10:29
Scientific analysis and historical research have supported the theory that the consumption of moldy bread may have played a role in the events of the Salem witch trials.

07:17-07:35
The history of witch hunting in Europe dates back to the 13th century and was influenced by the black death and the enclosure of common land.

07:40-07:58
During this period, women who were seen as threats to patriarchal authority, particularly unmarried or widowed women, were labeled as witches and criminalized.

08:03-10:32
These accusations were supported by sophisticated propaganda, including paintings depicting witches engaging in cannibalism and having sex with the devil.

04:51-09:23
The lecture discusses the history of witch hunting and its connection to colonization. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the feudal lords wanted to enclose the common land and criminalized cunning women who were outspoken and provided non-church sanctioned healing. These women were labeled as witches and subjected to violent evaluations. The same techniques used to villainize women were later employed to demonize indigenous peoples by the Spaniards during their colonization efforts in Latin America. The connection between the witch trials in Europe and the Salem witch trials in the United States is also highlighted.

09:23-10:29
One theory regarding the causes of the Salem witch trials is that the consumption of moldy bread led to hallucinations among the accused. This theory is based on scientific and historical investigations.

07:17-10:42
The lecture discusses the connection between the history of colonization and the criminalization of women, specifically focusing on the witch trials that took place in Europe. The speaker explains how the witch trials were a result of feudal Lords wanting to enclose the common land, which affected many unemployed women who were considered a threat as they went against traditional gender roles and relied on their own knowledge and healing practices. The speaker describes the methods used to villainize these women, including depicting them as witches who engaged in intercourse with the devil, had familiars, and cannibalized babies. This vilification technique was later applied to indigenous peoples by the Spaniards to justify their subjugation. The lecture also mentions the Salem witch trials as a product of this European witch hunting phase, with one theory suggesting that hallucinogenic properties in moldy bread caused the accused individuals to have visions and hallucinations.

07:40-10:45
The lecturer discusses how the tactics used to villainize women during the witch trials in Europe were later used to demonize indigenous peoples during the Spanish colonization of Latin America. The lecture covers the history of witch hunting and its connection to the enclosure of common land in Europe. The lecturer explains that women who were older or unmarried were often targeted as witches and were accused of engaging in intercourse with the devil and cannibalism. These accusations were supported by propaganda, including paintings depicting witches. As the colonization efforts in Latin America began, the same tactics used against women were employed to demonize indigenous peoples, with similar paintings showing them as cannibals and devil worshippers. The lecture highlights the connection between the witch trials and the later Salem witch trials in the United States, suggesting that the beliefs and practices from Europe were transported across the Atlantic.

07:17-10:50
The lecture discusses the connection between witch hunting and colonization. It begins by explaining how the history of colonization and the criminalization of women's autonomy are intertwined, especially in relation to the witch trials that occurred in Europe from the 13th to 16th centuries. The lecture highlights the impact of the Black Death in the 14th century, which led to a decrease in the population and the availability of land and employment. As feudal lords sought to enclose the commons and establish private ownership, they targeted unmarried, widowed, and older women known as cunning women, who challenged authority, including the Catholic Church's role in knowledge and healing. These women were often midwives and healers, providing reproductive care and remedies to the community. To justify their actions, the church and feudal lords labeled these women as witches, using propaganda and art, portraying them as engaging in intercourse with the devil and practicing cannibalism. The lecture then draws a parallel between the techniques used against women and the indigenous peoples during colonization, with similar themes depicted in paintings of indigenous people as cannibals and devil worshipers. The lecture suggests that the European witch hunting mentality influenced events like the Salem witch trials in the United States. It mentions the theory that hallucinogenic substances found in moldy bread consumed by the accused may have contributed to the hysteria. Overall, the lecture discusses the historical context and factors contributing to witch hunting and its connection to colonization.

05:08-07:35
The speaker explains that the same arguments and techniques used against women in the 13th and 14th centuries during the witch trials were later used to demonize indigenous peoples during colonization.

07:40-10:36
The speaker discusses the theories surrounding the Salem witch trials, including the idea that the consumption of moldy bread may have caused hallucinations among the accused witches.

08:08-09:13
The lecture discusses the use of the same arguments used against women in the 1300s and 1400s to criminalize widows and dispense with them during the colonization efforts.

09:16-09:31
These arguments were also used to villainize and justify the subjugation and exploitation of indigenous peoples in the 1540s and onwards.

09:36-10:29
The lecture mentions the theory that the Salem witch trials in 1692 were a result of consuming moldy bread that caused hallucinations.

10:32-10:45
The connection between witch hunting and colonization is explained, highlighting the European origins and the transport of witch hunting practices to the United States.

11:02-11:11
The lecture transitions to the topic of discussing the English colonization and the eventual formation of the United States.

07:50-08:41
In the 1540s, during Spain's colonization efforts in Latin America, indigenous people were demonized and depicted as cannibals and devil worshipers, similar to the witch trials in Europe where women were criminalized and accused of witchcraft.

08:46-09:23
The techniques used to villainize indigenous peoples were the same as those used against women during the witch trials, including depictions of cannibalism and accusations of being in congress with the devil.

09:23-09:36
The theory that the Salem witch trials were caused by the consumption of moldy bread is one possibility among various theories.

09:36-09:53
The connection between witch hunting and colonization highlights how the demonization of certain groups was used to justify exploitation and subjugation.

09:53-10:17
The lecture will now shift focus to the English colonization of what would become the United States, moving geographically from the Caribbean and Latin America.

07:40-09:23
The lecture discusses how the process of villainizing women during the witch trials in Europe was connected to the colonization of indigenous peoples in Latin America by Spain in the 1540s. Propaganda techniques used against women, such as painting them as witches and accusing them of engaging in sexual acts with the devil, were also applied to demonize indigenous peoples. The paintings depicted indigenous people as cannibals and devil worshipers, similar to the portrayal of witches in Europe.

09:23-09:36
The lecture mentions the Salem witch trials at the end of the witch hunting phase in Europe, happening in 1692 in the United States. Theories exist for the reasons behind the trials, including the consumption of moldy bread causing hallucinations.

09:36-11:24
The lecture transitions to discussing the colonization of what would become the United States by the English.

09:23-11:34
The lecture transitions into discussing the colonization of what would eventually become the United States, specifically focusing on early New England. The lecturer mentions that the previous discussion on witch hunting in Europe and colonization in Latin America is connected to the topic at hand. The lecture will now delve into the colonization efforts of the English in the United States.

08:03-10:17
The lecture discusses the connection between the witch trials in Europe and the demonization of indigenous peoples during colonization. It explains how the techniques used against women in the 13th and 14th centuries were later applied to justify the subjugation and exploitation of indigenous peoples in Latin America.

09:23-10:45
The lecture discusses the connection between the witch trials in Europe and the demonization of indigenous peoples during colonization. The speaker explains how women who owned and used common land were criminalized and labeled as witches, leading to their persecution. These same techniques were later used to demonize and justify the subjugation of indigenous peoples in the Americas. The lecture also mentions the Salem witch trials and speculates that the consumption of moldy bread may have caused hallucinations.

11:02-12:08
The lecture transitions to the topic of English colonization and the beginning of Protestantism. It mentions the importance of Martin Luther and the Reformation in shaping the religious landscape of Europe during the 1500s.

5:58-12:15
The lecture discusses the connection between the witch trials in Europe and the demonization of indigenous peoples during colonization. It starts by explaining the concept of commons, which was communal land used by everyone in the village or town. In the 15th century, feudal lords wanted to enclose the commons and turn them into private property. This led to the criminalization and witch-hunting of women who were seen as a threat to authority. The lecture highlights the role of cunning women who spoke out against authority and provided reproductive care for the community. The feudal lords and church used various propaganda techniques and paintings to vilify these women, portraying them as witches who engaged in congress with the devil and cannibalism. This witch-hunting phenomenon, which lasted for centuries, eventually traveled to the United States with the Salem witch trials. The lecture then transitions to discussing the colonization efforts of the English in what would become the United States. To understand this, the lecturer introduces Martin Luther and Protestantism as key historical factors.

09:23-12:22
The lecture discusses the connection between witch hunting in Europe and the colonization of indigenous peoples in Latin America by the Spanish. It explains how the techniques used to villainize women as witches in the 13th and 14th centuries were later used to demonize indigenous peoples. The lecture also mentions the Salem witch trials in the United States and offers various theories about its causes. Finally, it introduces the topic of the English colonization of what would become the United States and the influence of Martin Luther and Protestantism in the late medieval era.

04:08-07:17
The lecture discusses the process of criminalizing and demonizing women during the witch trials in Europe. Women who were seen as threats to authority and challenged the Catholic Church's monopoly on knowledge and healing were accused of being witches and face various forms of persecution. This practice began in the 14th and 15th centuries, with feudal Lords encroaching upon the common land used by communities and targeting women who relied on it.

07:23-09:36
The techniques used to villainize women in the witch trials were later applied by the Spaniards during their colonization efforts in Latin America. Indigenous people were portrayed as cannibals, devil worshipers, and having familiars, similar to the narrative used against women. These narratives were used as justifications for the subjugation, exploitation, and theft of indigenous lives and resources.

09:40-10:10
The lecture briefly mentions the Salem witch trials in the United States as a later manifestation of the witch hunting phenomenon, influenced by the European witch trials. The speaker presents one theory that suggests the consumption of moldy bread containing a particular type of yeast may have caused hallucinations, potentially contributing to the accusations during the trials.

11:11-11:40
The lecture transitions to discussing the English colonization of what would become the United States, focusing on early New England. This period will be the main topic of discussion in the upcoming lectures.

11:56-12:23
The lecture introduces Martin Luther and Protestantism as relevant figures and movements during the late medieval era that will form the backdrop for the discussion of English colonization.

09:13-12:28
The lecturer discusses the connection between witch hunting and the colonization of indigenous peoples. The techniques used to villainize women during the witch trials in the 1300s and 1400s were later applied to demonize indigenous peoples during the colonization efforts. The lecturer explains that indigenous peoples were depicted as cannibals, devil worshippers, and engaged in sexual activities with the devil, similar to how women were portrayed during the witch trials. These techniques of demonization and propagandization were used to justify the subjugation, exploitation, and theft of indigenous peoples' lands.

09:48-12:32
The lecture continues with a discussion on the English colonization of what would eventually become the United States, starting with New England. The professor explains that in order to understand the English colonization, it is necessary to go back in time to the 1500s and discuss Martin Luther and Protestantism. During the late medieval era, Martin Luther observes the corruption and inefficiency within the Catholic church. The Catholic church is described as having a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy that governs all aspects of people's lives in Europe.

07:17-10:29
The lecturer talks about the witch trials that took place in Europe between the 14th and 17th centuries, where women were criminalized and painted as witches. The churches and feudal Lords sought to enclose communal lands by getting these women off the land and they used various propaganda techniques to villainize them, such as accusing them of having sex with the devil, being cannibals, and having familiars. These techniques were later used to demonize indigenous peoples during colonization, particularly in Latin America, to justify their subjugation and exploitation.

11:02-12:08
The lecture transitions to discussing the colonization of what eventually becomes the United States by the English. To set the historical context, the lecturer introduces Martin Luther and Protestantism as a response to the corruption and inefficiency of the Catholic Church in the late medieval era.

09:48-10:29
The lecturer explains the connection between witch hunting in Europe and the colonization of indigenous peoples in the Americas. Women, often widows or unmarried, were criminalized and accused of being witches during the witch trials in Europe.

04:51-07:40
During the mid-15th century, feudal lords in Europe began enclosing common land, which affected cunning women who were widowed, never married, or homeless. These women were targeted by the feudal lords because they were seen as defiant to authority and the Catholic Church, and they provided reproductive care to others. In order to criminalize and remove these women, they were accused of being witches through propaganda, paintings, and decrees against witches. This witch hunting practice lasted for several centuries and eventually spread to the United States during the Salem witch trials.

07:40-08:25
The techniques used to villainize women as witches were later used against indigenous peoples in order to justify their subjugation, exploitation, and colonization by European settlers.
